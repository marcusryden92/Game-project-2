The task is to create an interactive webpage to demonstrate skills in Javascript, the possibility to work together both onsite and remotely, and collaborate on GitHub.

The project covers skills such as:
- using fundamental Javascript such as variables, loops, functions, objects, and arrays;
- using DOM manipulations to query, modify, and create elements;
- using EventListener to add interactivity;
- using The Web Storage to persist data;
- using the fetch API to get data from a 3rd party.



Best regards,
Carmela, Marcus and Maryana
